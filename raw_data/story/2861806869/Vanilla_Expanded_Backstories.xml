[PAWN_pronoun] would greet the sleepy villages along the line each morning with the cheery sound of the horn.

An enraged and sleep-deprived mob took the opportunity to destroy the train and [PAWN_nameDef] decided to leave before they remembered who was responsible for sounding the horn.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] is a firm believer in the right to bear arms and the right to arm bears. As such, [PAWN_pronoun] has an established reputation as one of the most prolific exporters in military surplus hardware. Many complain that [PAWN_pronoun] is perpetuating the ever-increasing scale of conflict between pirates and government military. However, [PAWN_possessive] counter-argument is that it's simply good business practice and the military should properly dispose of their own ordinance instead of relying on people like [PAWN_objective].</baseDesc>
