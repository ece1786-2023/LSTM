    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]'s family held their power base on a grand, ancient starship. Born and raised on the ship, [PAWN_nameDef] learned all about the rigors of shipboard life, and the politics and methods of interstellar battle and orbital invasion.
\n[PAWN_pronoun] learned to feel most at home with strong walls close on all sides and the gentle hiss of atmosphere regulators.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]'s parents did not want another heir. Fearing a succession fight, they decided to neutralize [PAWN_objective] early.
\nThey pampered [PAWN_nameDef] from birth, preventing [PAWN_objective] from developing the grit or knowledge necessary to be a threat to their favored son. [PAWN_nameDef] learned little more than how to manipulate the royal staff to get more food.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]'s noble family did not want [PAWN_objective], but could not afford to be seen directly assassinating [PAWN_objective] either. They attempted to get [PAWN_objective] killed by assigning [PAWN_objective] dangerous training without proper protection at too young an age.
\nAgainst all odds, [PAWN_nameDef] survived the jousting contests, horsewar matches, riverrun competitions and warzones. In the end, it only made [PAWN_objective] stronger.</baseDesc>
