	<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was chosen to be one of the children who were annually sacrificed to [PAWN_possessive] tribe’s gods, something that was considered a great honour. However, when the time came, [PAWN_nameDef] ran away. [PAWN_pronoun] survived on roots and berries in the wild until a different tribe, who worshiped gods that did not demand death, found [PAWN_objective].</baseDesc>

	<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was barely a toddler when [PAWN_pronoun] was kidnapped from [PAWN_possessive] settlement in a raid. The tribe who stole [PAWN_objective] believed that the advanced technology [PAWN_possessive] people had was magic, and that [PAWN_nameDef] was magic too. Although [PAWN_pronoun] did not manifest magical powers, the superior nutrition [PAWN_nameDef] received as an infant meant [PAWN_pronoun] was stronger than the other children in the tribe.</baseDesc>
